NSR (Nasjonalt skoleregister). Parses data fetched from the Norwegian national registry for schools, and parses it to Rails.

Data is fetched using the NSR script in [lnu-norge/experiments](https://github.com/lnu-norge/experiments/).

Specifically the ones in https://github.com/lnu-norge/experiments/tree/master/space-aggregator/fetchingData

You can read more about it in the readme there: https://github.com/lnu-norge/experiments/blob/master/space-aggregator/fetchingData/src/dataSources/Data%20Source%20README.md
